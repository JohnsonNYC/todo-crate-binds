# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

## Redemption

Seems like I did not show myself in the best light in the assessment. That may be due to how I deal with the testing environment. I'd like to show you myself in the best of light. This here is the same exact project with a bit of error handling and animations.

I hope you enjoy and thank you for your consideration!
